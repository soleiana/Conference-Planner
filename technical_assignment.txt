Technical assignment:
Implement following RESTful web service application using database and at least one of the following development frameworks.

Database:
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- SQLite (SQLite dialect will be attached)

Frameworks (back end):
- Spring Framework (http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/)
- Spring Data JPA (http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/)
- Hibernate (http://hibernate.org/orm/)

Frameworks (front end):
- AngularJS(https://angularjs.org/)

Project builder tool
- Maven

Database specification:
1.  CONFERENCE table
    columns:
    NAME:           Conference name, max length 150 characters
    DATE_TIME:      Conference date & time

2.  PARTICIPANT table
    columns:
    FULL_NAME:      Person full name
    BIRTH_DATE:     Date of birth

3. CONFERENCE_ROOM table
    columns:
    NAME:           Room name, like “M/S Baltic Queen conference”
    LOCATION:       M/S Baltic Queen
    MAX_SEATS:      124

NB!!! This is only approximate structure. Other fields, which are required to fulfill application requirements should be thought out by own self.

RESTful web service specification:

Conference management
- Create new conference
- Cancel conference
- Check conference room availability (based on registered participants and conference room max seats)

Conference participant management
- Add participant to conference
- Remove participant from conference

Additional information:
- For testing RESTful web service use REST-assured (https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/)
- For testing User Interface use SeleniumHQ (http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) or Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html)

Result should be sent to robert.kaev@tallink.ee and yury.repeshov@tallink.ee. It should be zip archive with:
1. Java source code
2. Web application configuration files
3. Database structure in SQL file
